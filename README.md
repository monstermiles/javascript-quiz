# javascript-quiz
This project is a simple quiz, made using JavaScript and CSS. The start screen displays some breif instructions and a list of high scores. Clicking the start button starts the timer, and begins the quiz.  There are five questions, and clicking on an answer moves the user on to the next question.  Each correct answer adds one to the score.  Once all of the questions are answered, or the timer reaches 0, the user is shown their score, and can input their initials.  Their initials and their score are then put in local storage, and added to the list of high scores.  

If I had more time to spend on this project, I would like to make the high scores list sort the scores as they are entered so they are displayed from highest to lowest.  I'd also like to limit the number of scores that can be stored, and have the lowest scores be removed once the max number of scores is reached.
